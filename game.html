              Our Team PUPR Vex Robotics is composed by a diverse group of
              students from<br />
              the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico. We have students from
              different<br />
              branches of engineering. We are very passionate engineering
              students that love<br />
              robotics and learning something new every day about STEM. Our main
              goal as<br />
              a team is to complete and exceed our expectation for our designs
              and<br />
              programs, acieving a top position or, even better, winning. We
              invite you to go<br />
              through our website to meet our team and more. We want you to be

              VEX Robotics Competition Over Under is played on a 12' x 12'
              square field configured as seen above. Two (2) Alliances - one (1)
              "red" and one (1) "blue" - composed of two (2) Teams each, compete
              in matches consisting of a fifteen (15) second Autonomous Period,
              followed by a one minute and forty-five second (1 :45) Driver
              Controlled Period.<br /><br />
              The <strong>object of the game</strong> is to attain a higher
              score than the opposing Alliance by Scoring Triballs in Goals, and
              by Elevating at the end of the Match.

            <p style="font-size: 18px">
              In the VRC Over Under field, there are sixty (60) Triballs, which
              are used in the game. The field features two netted Goals located
              on opposite sides, and it is divided by a 2" PVC Barrier, creating
              a Red Offensive Zone and a Blue Offensive Zone. Scoring Triballs
              in a Goal earns a team five (5) points, while placing a Triball in
              an Offensive Zone is worth two (2) points. Additionally, the field
              includes Alliance-specific pipes called Elevation Bars, situated
              on each side of the Barrier. These Elevation Bars are used at the
              end of the match to elevate robots. The height of each robot off
              the ground is measured to determine its Elevation Tier, and points
              are awarded based on each robot's Tier relative to others. The
              Elevation Tiers start at ground level and extend above the
              Elevation Bar. <br /><br />During the Autonomous period, the
              Alliance that scores more points receives an additional eight (8)
              bonus points, which are added to the final score at the end of the
              match. Both Alliances have the opportunity to earn an Autonomous
              Win Point by completing three assigned tasks, regardless of which
              Alliance wins the Autonomous Bonus.
